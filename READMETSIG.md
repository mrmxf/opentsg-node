# TSIG Demo

TSIG stands for Test Signal Input Geometry. It is used for mapping flat images to 3d displays.

This demo will walk you through generating a pattern for a 2d display, and then for a 3d object that requires a TSIG file.

The demo has the following contents:

- [Pre Requisites](#pre-requisites)
- [How do TSIGs work](#how-do-tsigs-work)
- [Running the demo](#demo)
- [TSIG technical info](#tsig-technical-information)

## Pre requisites

In order to get the most out of this demo and to make
sure it runs as intended, please make sure you have done the following.

- Installed / Built openTSG
- You have read the documentation and are familiar with OpenTSG

## How do TSIGs work

A TSIG  (test pattern input geometry) file tells OpenTSG how to map a 3d object into a 2d image, so the image can then be displayed on the 3d display. This works by flattening the object into a base test pattern layout using the TSIG, then running openTSG with that base test pattern. The base test pattern can then be applied to the 3d display.

## Demo

This demo runs OpenTSG, generating the ebu3373 test pattern, for the TSIG geometry of a simple house and a standard 2d image.
You will get out two images, the first is ebu3373 which will be found at`./tsig/example/ebu3373.png`, then the
TSIG version which will be found at `./tsig/example/ebuHouse.png`.

Please make sure you have followed the installation instructions in the README, and that OpenTSG is running, before starting the demo

All output from the demo will be saved in the  `tsig/example` folder.

To generate the flat 2d image witn **no** geometry run  `./opentsg-node -c tsig/loadergrid.json --debug`.
This generates the OpenTPG ebu3373 chart, as a flat test pattern.

The output should look like

<img src="./_docs/_images/ebu3373.png" alt="House TSIG" width="500"/>

To generate a  TSIG for the house geometry  run `./opentsg-node -c tsig/loaderTSIG.json --debug`. This now uses a canvas file that has TSIG geometry.

The only difference between this and the previous input json is

the first input json (`tsig/gridexample.json`) had

```javascript
"canvas":{}
```

which has been updated to.

```javascript
"canvas":{    
    "name": [
      "./tsig/example/ebuHouse.png"
      ],
    "geometry":"./objBases/house.json"
  }
```

Which has now added the geometry field into the canvas options file (`tsig/base.json`)
for openTSG to use. (And the file name to avoid clashes)

The output should look like

<img src="./_docs/_images/ebuHouse.png" alt="House TSIG" width="500"/>

Try visualising the test pattern geometry with Blender ( or other services ).
Using the house obj at `tsig/objBases/house.obj` and the generated image  you made at `tsig/example/out.png`.

It will look something like

<img src="./_docs/_images/houseBlenderViewWrapped.jpg" alt="House TSIG" width="500"/>

Congratulations! You made your first test pattern for a 3d object ðŸŽ‰

### Next steps

Try running it with more TSIGs (Yet to be added)

## TSIG Technical information

The size of the TSIG canvas supersedes the base canvas size in the json,
which is why the demo produces two sized different images (the TSIG image should be bigger).

### Widgets Built for TSIGs

Some widgets are built for geometric patterns in mind.
When these are used without a TSIG, the standard grid layout
of OpenTSG is used as the default to allow the widget to run.

The complete list of TSIG widgets is given below.

- [Four colour](https://github.com/mrmxf/opentsg-modules/blob/main/opentsg-widgets/_docs/fourcolour/doc.md)

### GridKeys

`"useGridKeys"` is an alternative way of generating the area a widget patch will cover,
with in the `"props"` field.
It is an array of strings of areas for the widget to cover, the available prefixes are:

- `tsig:` - for selecting:
  - tile IDs - e.g. `tsig:A1`
  - groups - e.g. `tsig:ExampleGroup`
  - Specific types of groups - e.g. `tsig:ExampleGroup.ExampleField`

The patch that is generated, is compiled of every grid key that is called. It is masked
so that tiles not associated with the grid keys are not included.

## The TSIG property

The `TSIG` field of thw widget properties allows manipulation of the TSIGs that
the widget receives as part of its request.

`grouping` groups the TSIGs into the groups given in the TSIG,
instead of the default base units of the TSIG. e.g. 3 tiles that have the groups:

1. `example:A1`
2. `example:A2`
3. `example:A1`

Will produce 2 TSIgs of A1 and A2.
If every TSIG tile does not have the unit searched for than an error has returned.

```javascript
"props":{
 "TSIG": {
        "grouping":"example"
    }
}  
```

e.g.

```json
{
  "props": {
    "type" : "builtin.example",
    "location" : {
      "box" : {
        "useGridKeys" : ["tsig:B1"]
      }
    },
     "TSIG": {
        "grouping":"example"
    }
  }
}
```
